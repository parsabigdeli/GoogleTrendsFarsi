# GoogleTrendsFarsi
This repository includes Python codes for using Google Trends official API. It will fetch interest over time, top/rising queries, and top/rising topics. You can set date and region filters.

In particular, it contains the ISO codes for Iran's provinces (Update: July 2023) in case you want to set the region filter to provinces to get more specific data. 

Note that you need Google's official developers' key(the API key) to use these codes :)
